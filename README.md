# greenspace
Find and rate a green space near you.

Google Maps will show you where all of your nearest green spots are, but it rarely gives away the important details. If you're looking for somewhere relaxing to eat your lunch, you'll probably be fairly disappointed if when you arrive there, you find its calm shattered by noisy traffic and the sun obscured by tall buildings on all sides.

GreenspaceApps aims to tackle this lack of information, to help people find a desirable space for a little peace.

Build on Rails, this app will work similarly to Yelp, allowing users to sign up and add ratings and reviews about their experiences of certain greenspaces, from the biggest parks to the smallest grassy patches.
